# MongoDB Integration Summary

## Task Completed ✅
Successfully replaced the in-memory database in the Deno Fresh film booking application with MongoDB.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Configuration
- **Added MongoDB driver**: Updated `deno.json` to include `"mongodb": "npm:mongodb@^6.0.0"`
- **Environment variables**: Created `.env` file with MongoDB connection settings:
  ```
  MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017
  DB_NAME=film_booking
  ```

### 2. Database Layer (MongoDB Implementation)
- **Created `/app/utils/mongodb.ts`**: MongoDB connection utilities and collection helpers
- **Replaced `/app/utils/database.ts`**: Completely rewritten to use MongoDB instead of in-memory Maps
  - Users collection
  - Movies collection
  - Screenings collection
  - Bookings collection
  - Snacks collection
  - BookingSnacks collection
  - Admins collection
  - Sessions collection

### 3. Session Management Updates
- **Updated `/app/utils/session.ts`**: Made all functions async to work with MongoDB operations
  - `getCurrentUser()` → async function
  - `createSessionResponse()` → async function
  - `destroySessionResponse()` → async function
  - `requireAuth()` → async function

### 4. Route Handlers Updates
Updated all route handlers to use async MongoDB operations:
- **`/app/routes/login.tsx`**: Authentication with MongoDB
- **`/app/routes/register.tsx`**: User registration with MongoDB
- **`/app/routes/index.tsx`**: Homepage data from MongoDB
- **`/app/routes/movies.tsx`**: Movies listing from MongoDB
- **`/app/routes/book/[id].tsx`**: Movie booking data from MongoDB
- **`/app/routes/api/book.ts`**: Booking API with MongoDB
- **`/app/routes/api/logout.ts`**: Session management with MongoDB

### 5. Data Initialization
The application automatically initializes with sample data on first run:
- **3 Movies**: Black Panther, Supergirl, Wanda Vision
- **105 Screenings**: 7 days × 5 time slots × 3 movies
- **5 Snacks**: Popcorn varieties, drinks, candy, combos
- **1 Admin**: username: `admin`, password: `admin123`

## MongoDB Collections Created
```
film_booking (database)
├── movies (3 documents)
├── screenings (105 documents)
├── snacks (5 documents)
├── admins (1 document)
├── users (empty, populated during registration)
├── bookings (empty, populated during booking)
├── booking_snacks (empty, populated during booking)
└── sessions (empty, populated during login)
```

## API Compatibility
All existing API endpoints remain 100% compatible:
- ✅ User authentication and registration
- ✅ Movie browsing and filtering
- ✅ Booking system with snacks
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ All frontend components work unchanged

## What Was Removed
- ✅ All in-memory Map storage
- ✅ FastAPI + React structure (as requested)
- ✅ Any backup files or unnecessary code

## Testing Verified
- ✅ Homepage loads with movies from MongoDB
- ✅ Movies page displays data from MongoDB
- ✅ Login/register pages functional
- ✅ MongoDB collections contain expected data
- ✅ Fresh server running on http://localhost:8000

## Technical Notes
- Uses npm:mongodb driver for better compatibility
- All database operations are properly async
- UUIDs used instead of MongoDB ObjectIDs for easier serialization
- Environment variables properly configured
- Sample data initialization happens automatically on startup
